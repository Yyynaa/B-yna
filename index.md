Blackpink made their debut in 2016 with the short album Square One, which had only two songs — "Whistle" and "Boombayah." The debut was widely pushed in the K-pop world because Blackpink was YG Entertainment's first girl group in seven years.The four-member (Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, Lisa) South Korean girl band — who get their name from the mixture of tough "black" and flirty "pink" of their songs — have been global superstars since the release of their June 2016 single "Boombayah."

# What is the significance of the name Blackpink?

According to the statement, "the connotation of BLACKPINK intends to contrast the popular idea of the hue pink." "Pink is typically used to depict prettiness, but _BLACKPINK_  truly means 'Pretty isn't everything.' It also represents that they are a team that includes not just beauty, but also excellent skill."


# Who are the members of Blackpink?


## Kim Jisoo

Kim Jisoo is a singer, often referred to as "adorable" by BLINKs (the official name of Blackpink fans). She's known her steadiness and composure — and for balancing random objects on her head or shoulders — previous videos showed her with a cup or an award on her head. The BLACKPINK member is the only one who has not made her solo debut, however this will change very soon, as she recently announced that it will be released in 2022. Jisoo has everyone captivated with her K-Drama “Snowdrop“.
